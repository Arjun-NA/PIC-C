Here for beginners can get thier head around the basic programming keywords in PIC .<br> All programs are based on PIC16F877a <br>
If u r looking for a PIC burner and software for pic try searching PICKIT3 and u will get both. <br>
Thank you

The first program in any Electronic boards or ICs is always the blink. I have uploaded the blink.c as a "hello world" for you
