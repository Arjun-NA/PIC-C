# Pic c programs.
<hr>
<span></span>
<br>
Here for beginners can get their head around the basic programming keywords in PIC .<br> All programs are based on PIC16F877a <br>
If you are looking for a PIC burner and software for pic try searching PICKIT3 and you will get both. <br>
Thank you

The first program in any Electronic boards or ICs is always the blink. I have uploaded the [Hello world](blink.c) for you<br>
Here the delay is 900 milliseconds ; i.e , 900 millis LED ON and 900 millis LED OFF
